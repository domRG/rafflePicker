# rafflePicker

A quick project to generate some winning numbers from a user-provided range. It is also possible to specify numbers to exclude from the range.

## Build & Execution

The latest release contains the .exe (and SHA-256) generated from compiling `main.py` using (PyInstaller)[https://www.pyinstaller.org/index.html].

If you wish to build this yourself, the command I used is as follows: `pyinstaller main.py --onefile --console --name rafflePicker` to generate a single file executable.
